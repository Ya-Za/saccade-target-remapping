# Trace extrastriate response changes and decompose them into their constituent components, using a combined physiological and computational approach

Using temporally and spatially precise measurement of V4 and MT RFs around the time of saccades, we have discovered a novel extrastriate mechanism for the maintenance of visual information across saccades. A subpopulation of extrastriate neurons shows persistent activity, maintaining the information from their original RF across the saccade. We also observe saccade target (ST) and future field (FF) remapping, in which neurons preemptively shift their sensitivity towards the saccade target or their future RF. In order to examine the sufficiency of these neural changes for visual stability, we develop a novel extension of the generalized linear model framework to capture perisaccadic changes in neuronsâ€™ visual responses, and decompose perisaccadic responses at each timepoint into multiple independent sources.
